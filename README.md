# seismic-detection

## Mission
Planetary seismology missions struggle with the power requirements necessary to send continuous seismic data back to Earth. But only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful. Therefore we created a solution which would allow the lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data which matters.

## Solution
1.
2.
3.

## Discarded solutions, why?
- Single Window Maeda-AIC (SWM-AIC) algorithm, did not fit our 1C data well since it is more sueful for 3C
- LTA/STA triggering, was found to be unrealiable at cutting through the noise in the raw data
- Machine Learning Model, considered unreliable by NASA and ourselves - which is why we went with a deterministic solution
