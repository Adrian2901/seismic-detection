## Things we know

- Reduce noise from a signal
- Reduce size so sending it requires more energy ?
- Algorithm to diferentiate
- Other planets may have different signals so we have to be careful with that

## What to do

- Write a computer program to analyze the data
- There is as jupyter notebook with examples to get started
- There are also some datasets that we can use if we want to train models
- Useful algorithms:
    - Short-term average ratio (STA)
    - Long-term average ratio (LTA)
    - Machine learning techniques??
- We should first look at the data and see what we can find
